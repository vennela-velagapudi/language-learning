        <p><strong>2. How We Use Your Information:</strong> 
            Your data helps us tailor the learning experience to your specific needs by offering personalized recommendations, progress tracking, and customized content. We analyze user activity to identify popular features, address areas needing improvement, and enhance overall performance.

This includes the use of encryption protocols, secure data storage systems, and routine security audits to detect and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Our servers are housed in secure data centers with restricted access, and our team is trained in best practices for data protection. While no system is entirely foolproof, we continuously update our technology and processes to stay ahead of emerging security threats.
